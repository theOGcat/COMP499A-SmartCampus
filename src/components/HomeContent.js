        <h2>Related Policies and Terms
Additional policies and terms apply to use of specific portions of the Sites and to the purchase of certain Merchandise or Services and are included as part of the Site Terms. Please refer to and review all additional specific terms and conditions at the Sites. The Site Terms apply exclusively to your access to, and use of, the Sites and do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Costco for products, services, or otherwise. Costco has adopted a Privacy Policy that you should refer to in order to fully understand how we use, collect and disclose personal information and personal health information. To learn about Costco's privacy practices, please refer to the Privacy Policy section of the Sites. By using the Sites, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and personal health information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.c

Modification of Site Terms
Costco reserves the right to modify these Site Terms in our sole discretion from time to time and only Costco has the right to do so. If the Site Terms are changed, we will post the new terms on the Sites and note the date they were last updated. Any changes or modification will be effective upon posting of the Site Terms as revised, and your use of the Sites following the posting will constitute your acceptance of the new Site Terms.

Canadian Usage
The Sites may only be used by residents of Canada to order goods or services intended to be delivered to addresses in Canada. Use of the Sites is governed by the provincial and federal laws of Canada. The laws of your jurisdiction may be more or less stricter than the laws that apply to the Sites. If you access the Sites from outside Canada, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.

Licence and Site Access
Costco grants you a limited licence to view the Sites, to print individual pages from the Sites, and electronically copy pages from the Sites for the sole purpose of using materials it contains for informational and non-commercial, personal use only. This licence is conditional on your strict compliance and acceptance without modification of the Site Terms.
This licence does not include, without limitation: (a) any resale or commercial use of the Sites or any Site Materials (defined below); (b) modification, adaptation, translation, reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly or conversion into human readable form any of the Site Materials not intended to be so read, including use of or directly viewing the underlying HTML or other code from the Sites except as interpreted and displayed in a Web browser; (c) copying, imitating, mirroring, reproducing, distributing, publishing, making available, downloading, displaying, performing, posting or transmitting any Site Materials (including any Costco trademarks) in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or other means; (d) the collection, use or disclosure of any product listings, prices or descriptions; (e) making derivative uses of the Sites and any Site Materials; or (f) use of any data mining, bots, spiders, automated tools or similar data gathering and extraction methods, directly or indirectly, on the Site Materials or to scrape or collect any information from the Sites or any other user of the Sites.
Except as noted above, you are not conveyed any right or licence by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise in or under a patent, trademark, copyright, or proprietary right of Costco or any third party. You may not use any meta tags or any other “hidden text” utilizing Costco's corporate names, trade names, trademarks, product names or service names without our express written consent. “Site Materials” means all information, software and materials on the Sites, including, without limitation, trademarks (as specifically defined in these Site Terms) design, product names, prices and descriptions, HTML text, graphics, other files, photographs, codes, layout, designs, forms and the selection and arrangement thereof.
We may terminate this licence and your use of or access to the Sites if you make or permit any unauthorized use of the Sites. Such actions by you may violate applicable law including, without limitation, copyright laws, trademark laws (including trade dress), patent laws, and communications regulations and statutes. We reserve the right to initiate civil or criminal proceedings, or both, against all violators to the fullest extent of the law.

Changes, Misprints and Errors
Subject to applicable law, we: (a) reserve the right to change the goods and services advertised or offered for sale through the Sites, the prices or specifications of such goods and services, and any promotional offers and any other Site Materials at any time and from time to time without any notice or liability to you or any other person; (b) cannot guarantee that goods or services advertised or offered for sale on the Sites will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) do not warrant that the Site Materials (including without limitation product descriptions or photographs) are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserve the right to cancel, to terminate or not to process orders (including accepted orders) where the price or other material information on the Sites is inaccurate or when we recognize abuse of our policies. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will advise you that the order has been cancelled and will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you.
