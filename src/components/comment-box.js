    Before we can start dealing with our internal state in our component, we need to set up an initial state.
    To do that, we’ll need to implement a constructor for our class
    (a function that is called when the class is used anywhere).
    constructor() is a special function that ES2015 functions rely on to perform some actions when the class is used
    (usually referred to as “instantiation”).
    As I mentioned previously, it needs to accept a “props” argument.
    It also needs to call out to its parent constructor, which it does via the call to super(props).
    This calls the parent’s constructor (which since it is a Component too is also expecting props passed to it).
    Then, we set a property on the class called “state” via the this.state declaration.

    // by doing this we are relying on the garbage collector to get rid of those objects over time
    // whereas if we pre-bind them we are only using one memory reference

    // Why do we use bind? Because any events that need to access any internal object details
    // need to be explicitly bound to that instance of that component
    // In simpler terms, that means that “this._addComment” doesn’t really know how to call “this.setState”,
    // because it doesn't understand what this is supposed to refer to
    // bind(this) tells Javascript “Hey, any time you see a reference to this inside of the _addComment function,
    // I want you specifically to refer to ME CommentBox”
