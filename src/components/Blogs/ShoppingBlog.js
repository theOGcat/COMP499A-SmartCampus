           largest mall in Windsor. Devonshire Mall was sold by Ivanho√© Cambridge in 2015 to the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan and is 
           currently operated by Cushman & Wakefield.  
           An inviting and Beautiful Shopping Experience
            The retail expansion is complimented by a program of renovations throughout the mall creating
              a bright, modern and welcoming feel throughout the centre. Floor and ceiling treatment
          construction continues as well as the upgrades at each entranceway and the addition of the
          new entranceway leading to the new food court.

          <Typography variant="h4">About Costco Wholesale</Typography>
          Costco Wholesale Corporation (doing business as Costco Wholesale and also known simply as Costco) is an American multinational 
          corporation which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores (warehouse club). As of 2020, Costco was the fifth 
          largest retailer in the world,and the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and 
          wine as of 2016. In 2021, Costco was ranked #10 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total 
          revenue. Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, an eastern suburb of Seattle, although its Kirkland Signature 
          house label bears the name of its former location in Kirkland. The company opened its first warehouse (the chain's term for its 
          retail outlets) in Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, however, Costco's corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former 
          competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California. As of March 2021, Costco has 804 warehouses worldwide:
          558 in the United States (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), 103 in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom, 
          27 in Japan, 16 in South Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 13 in Australia, 4 in Spain, 2 in France, 1 in Iceland and 1 in mainland China. Costco 
          regularly opens new locations. The company plans to open warehouses in 2022 for the first time in New Zealand, and Sweden.
          Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena 
          Boulevard in San Diego, California. This gave birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club 
          Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco 
          Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
